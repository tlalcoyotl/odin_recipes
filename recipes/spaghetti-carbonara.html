    <h2 class="header">Description</h2>
    <p>This spaghetti carbonara recipe comes from an Italian, unlike a lot of recipes out there for spaghetti carbonara. It's very true to what you'd find in Italy. Top with extra Pecorino-Romano cheese, salt, and pepper. Note, there's no cream, just eggs, and Pecorino Romano cheese is used, not Parmesan.</p>
    <h2 class="header">Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) package spaghetti</li>
        <li>5 ounces guanciale (cured pork cheek), cut into small cubes</li>
        <li>3 egg yolks</li>
        <li>1 whole egg</li>
        <li>Â¾ cup grated Pecorino-Romano cheese</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="header">Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in spaghetti and return to a boil. Cook pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Reserve a little pasta water, then drain.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat a skillet over medium heat; add guanciale, cook and stir until crisp, 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Whisk egg yolks and whole egg together in a bowl; whisk in cheese, salt, and pepper until combined.</li>
        <li>Stir in guanciale. Add spaghetti; toss until evenly coated.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2 class="header">Cook's Note</h2>
    <p>If the egg mixture becomes too thick, add a little pasta cooking water to dilute the sauce. But remember, the eggs should never be scrambled!</p>
